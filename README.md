# story-magic-reader

I want to create a web app that read stories to the users. These stories are customized given what users have selected (point of view, era, writing style, ...) and are created by chatgpt. The text is then read to the user using elevenlab (text to speech). The backend is only in python and the front in html/css (no js)
